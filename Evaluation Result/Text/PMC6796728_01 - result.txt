Given the patient's history of HIV, poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the presence of a cough, intermittent gastrointestinal symptoms, and weight loss, tuberculosis (TB) should be considered, especially in the context of abdominal findings.

However, the acute abdominal pain, signs of peritonitis, and the surgical findings of bowel wall disruption are more suggestive of a severe intra-abdominal infection or inflammatory process.

While TB can present with abdominal symptoms, it's less common than other infectious etiologies in an HIV-positive patient with a history of poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy.

Therefore, TB is a possible, but not the most likely, etiology.

Given the clinical picture, the most likely diagnosis is a severe intra-abdominal infection or inflammatory process, potentially related to a bacterial translocation from the lungs (e.g., due to TB) or another opportunistic infection.

Further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause.

Recommendation: While TB is a consideration, the clinical picture is more suggestive of a severe intra-abdominal infection or inflammatory process. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
