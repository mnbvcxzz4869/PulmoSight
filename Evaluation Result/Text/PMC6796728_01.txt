Case: 
Patient Information
- Age: 26 years
- Sex: Female
- Past Medical History: Known HIV infection since adolescence
- Treatment History: Inconsistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy and poor follow-up over the past year

Presenting Complaint
- Acute worsening abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting

History of Present Illness
The patient presented to the emergency department with a 10-day history of intermittent lower abdominal pain, accompanied by nausea, episodes of vomiting, and generalized weakness. Approximately 24 hours prior to admission, the abdominal pain intensified and became constant.

During the past several months, the patient reports:
- Intermittent cough
- Episodes of gastrointestinal symptoms, including changes in bowel habits
- Progressive, unintentional weight loss

She did not seek medical attention for these symptoms and has missed most of her routine medical follow-ups. Recent laboratory monitoring related to her HIV infection has not been performed.

Physical Examination on Presentation
- Appears acutely ill and dehydrated
- Vital signs suggest hemodynamic instability
- Abdomen is diffusely tender, with pain exacerbated by palpation
- No focal abdominal mass detected on examination

Initial Laboratory Findings
- Evidence of an inflammatory response
- Metabolic abnormalities consistent with systemic illness

Initial Clinical Assessment
Given the combination of acute abdominal findings and systemic instability in a patient with known HIV and poor treatment adherence, a severe intra-abdominal process was suspected, and urgent surgical evaluation was requested.

Emergency Management and Operative Findings
The patient underwent emergency surgical exploration. Intraoperatively, significant intra-abdominal contamination was encountered, along with multiple areas of bowel wall disruption involving both the distal small intestine and the proximal large intestine.

Resection of the affected bowel segments was performed, followed by restoration of bowel continuity. Extensive abdominal lavage was carried out, and no immediate surgical complications were noted.

Postoperative Course (Early)
- Hemodynamic status improved with supportive care
- Broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy was initiated
- Oral intake was gradually resumed without early complications

Etiological Considerations
At the time of initial management, the underlying cause of the bowel pathology remained unclear. Given the patient’s immunocompromised status, several possibilities were considered, including:
- Opportunistic infections
- Chronic inflammatory conditions
- Neoplastic processes

Definitive diagnostic studies and specialized laboratory tests were not immediately available.

Follow-up Status
The patient left the hospital before a complete diagnostic evaluation and long-term management plan could be established. Subsequent clinical information was initially unavailable.
