Patient Information
- Age: 11 years
- Sex: Male

Presenting Complaint
- Gradual enlargement of the left breast/chest wall region over approximately one year

History of Present Illness
The patient presents with a slowly progressive enlargement of the left anterior chest wall over the past year. The swelling has gradually increased in size and has caused elevation of the nipple–areolar region. There has been no sudden change in size and no history of acute inflammation.

The patient has been evaluated multiple times and was previously reassured with a provisional diagnosis related to benign breast enlargement, without definitive intervention.

He denies:
- Pain at the swelling site
- Fever
- Weight loss
- Night sweats
- Respiratory symptoms

There is no reported history of:
- Trauma to the chest wall
- Previous surgery
- Chronic illness
- Long-term medication use

Past medical, surgical, family, and drug history are unremarkable.

Physical Examination
- Firm swelling involving the left anterior chest wall
- Ill-defined margins
- Non-tender on palpation
- No fluctuation or transillumination
- Overlying skin appears normal
- Elevation of the nipple–areolar complex noted
- Vital signs within normal limits

Initial Investigations
- Routine blood tests reported as within normal limits
- Initial imaging suggested a cystic-appearing lesion with surrounding structural involvement

Initial Clinical Impression
- Chronic chest wall mass of unclear etiology
- Differential considerations include inflammatory, developmental, or neoplastic processes
- No definitive diagnosis established at this stage
