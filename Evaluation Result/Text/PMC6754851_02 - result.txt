Given the patient's age, presentation with a nasopharyngeal mass and cervical lymphadenopathy, and the biopsy result, the following considerations are relevant:

Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC): This is a primary malignancy of the nasopharynx, strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, particularly in endemic regions. The location of the mass (nasopharynx) and the presence of cervical lymphadenopathy are highly suggestive.
Tuberculosis (TB): While TB can certainly cause cervical lymphadenopathy and nasal obstruction, it is less common in a 17-year-old, especially without a clear history of exposure or risk factors. However, it's important to consider, especially given the patient's age.
Other possibilities: Other possibilities include fungal infections, inflammatory conditions, or other less common tumors.
Given the patient's age and the presence of a nasopharyngeal mass, Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) is a strong consideration. The biopsy result will be crucial in confirming this diagnosis.

Therefore, while TB is a possibility, the clinical picture is more suggestive of a nasopharyngeal malignancy.

Next Steps:

Histopathology: The results of the biopsy are critical. They will help determine if the mass is cancerous and, if so, whether it is NPC.
EBV Status: If NPC is confirmed, EBV status should be assessed.
Further Imaging: Further imaging, such as CT or MRI of the head and neck, may be helpful to delineate the extent of the tumor and assess for regional or distant spread.
Consider referral to a specialist: A specialist in head and neck oncology is recommended for further management.
In summary, while TB is a possibility, the clinical picture is more suggestive of a nasopharyngeal malignancy. The histopathology of the biopsy is the most important next step.
