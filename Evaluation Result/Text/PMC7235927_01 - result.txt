Given the patient's history of progressive knee swelling and pain, along with unintentional weight loss, it is important to consider the possibility of tuberculosis (TB), especially given the history of a motorcycle accident. While the patient denies respiratory symptoms, TB can present with extrapulmonary manifestations, including joint involvement.

However, the lack of respiratory symptoms and the absence of a known exposure history make TB less likely.

Therefore, while TB should be considered, it is not the most likely diagnosis at this point. Further investigation is warranted to rule out other potential causes of the knee condition.

Next Steps:

Chest Radiograph: A chest radiograph is crucial to evaluate for pulmonary TB.
Sputum Smear and Culture: If the chest radiograph is normal or equivocal, a sputum smear and culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis should be considered, especially if the patient has any risk factors for TB.
Consider other causes: While TB is a consideration, the patient's history of trauma and the lack of respiratory symptoms should prompt consideration of other possible diagnoses, such as osteoarthritis, inflammatory arthritis, or other musculoskeletal conditions.
Important Note: This is a preliminary assessment based on limited information. A definitive diagnosis requires a comprehensive evaluation, including a thorough history, physical examination, and appropriate investigations.
