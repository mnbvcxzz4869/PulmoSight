Okay, I understand. Based on the information provided, the patient presents with a chronic, progressive swelling and pain in the left ankle joint, with limited range of motion. The patient denies systemic symptoms like fever, weight loss, or night sweats, and there is no history of trauma or prior joint disease. Inflammatory markers are mildly elevated.

Given the lack of systemic symptoms and the absence of a clear history of trauma or joint disease, the initial clinical impression is a chronic monoarticular ankle pathology of unclear etiology.

While the patient's ethnicity (Sri Lankan) is relevant for considering certain infectious diseases, the absence of respiratory symptoms and systemic complaints makes Tuberculosis (TB) less likely at this stage. However, TB can present with musculoskeletal symptoms, particularly in endemic areas.

Therefore, while TB is not the primary consideration at this point, it should be kept in the differential diagnosis, especially given the patient's Sri Lankan ethnicity and the chronic nature of the symptoms.

Next Steps:

Further imaging: An ultrasound of the ankle joint may be helpful to evaluate for fluid collection, synovial thickening, or other signs of inflammation.
Consider other causes: Given the lack of systemic symptoms, other potential causes of chronic monoarticular arthritis, such as inflammatory arthritis (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis), crystal arthropathy (e.g., gout, pseudogout), or a reactive arthritis, should be considered.
Review the patient's travel history: Although the patient denies respiratory symptoms, a thorough travel history is still important to assess for potential exposure to TB, especially in endemic areas.
Consider referral to a specialist: If the diagnosis remains unclear after further investigation, referral to a rheumatologist or orthopedic surgeon may be appropriate.
In summary, while the patient's presentation is more suggestive of a non-infectious cause, TB should be considered in the differential diagnosis, particularly given the patient's ethnicity and the chronic nature of the symptoms. Further investigation is needed to establish a definitive diagnosis.
